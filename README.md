## ðŸš€ How to run

- Ensure that expo and iOS and Android simulators have been installed and configured
- Install packages with `yarn install`
- Run `yarn start` to start the bundler.
- To run on specific devices:
  - iOS: Ensure the iOS simulator is running and type `i` from within the running yarn start
  - Android: Ensure the Android simulator is running and type `a` from within the running yarn start
  - Web: type `w` and a new tab will open in your browser

## n.b.
- Working code for notifications has been copied from the course lessons/project and the latest expo docs. However, to my knowledge, there is no way to fully test the notifications within the simulators
- opening the app on the web results in the following warning `Compiled with warnings.
/Users/kentjakel/Udacity/React/ReactNativeMobileFlashcards/node_modules/@react-navigation/bottom-tabs/lib/module/views/ResourceSavingScene.js
Attempted import error: 'shouldUseActivityState' is not exported from 'react-native-screens'.`, which seems to be an unresolved issue in the react-navigation GitHub repo
